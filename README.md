# Console Calculator B2A

## Overview  
Console Calculator B2A (Beginner to Advanced) is a simple console-based calculator application designed as a learning project. It evolves gradually from a basic calculator into an advanced tool with more sophisticated features. The long-term goal is to progress toward a fully functional GUI-based calculator.

This project welcomes contributions and feedback to improve coding practices, add features, and refine the application. Testers and developers are encouraged to participate in identifying bugs, suggesting improvements, and helping it grow.

## Features  
- Basic arithmetic operations:  
  - Addition  
  - Subtraction  
  - Multiplication  
  - Division (with division by zero handling)  
- Simple, interactive console menu for operation selection  
- Modular project structure with separation of concerns  
- Centralized input handling and error reporting  
- Self-contained .NET application (supports Windows systems)

## Roadmap  

### Current Version: v0.2.0  
- Modular folder structure (Operations, Requests, ErrorHandling)  
- Replaced application icon from `ccico.ico` to `icon.ico` (requires rebuilding executable)  
- Improved input validation and error messages  
- Removed obsolete files for clarity and maintainability  

### Future Milestones:  
- Add support for advanced operations (e.g., exponentiation, modulus, square root)  
- Expand input validation and error handling  
- Add unit tests for operations  
- Refactor using interfaces for extensibility (`IOperation`)  
- Transition to a GUI-based application
