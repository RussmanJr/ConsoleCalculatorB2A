# Console Calculator B2A

## Overview
**Console Calculator B2A** (Beginner to Advanced) is a simple console-based calculator application. It is designed as a learning project to gradually evolve from a basic calculator into an advanced tool with more sophisticated features. The long-term goal is to progress towards a fully functional GUI-based calculator.

This project welcomes contributions and feedback to improve coding practices, add features, and refine the application. Testers and developers are encouraged to participate in identifying bugs, suggesting improvements, and helping it grow.

## Features
- **Basic arithmetic operations**:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Division (with division by zero handling)
- **Simple, interactive console menu** for operation selection
- **Self-contained .NET application** (supports Windows systems)

## Roadmap
1. **Current Version**: `v0.1.0`
   - Basic console-based functionality.
   - Structured for extensibility.

2. **Future Milestones**:
   - Add support for advanced operations (e.g., exponentiation, modulus, square root).
   - Improve input validation and error handling.
   - Refactor code to increase modularity and scalability.
   - Transition to a GUI-based application in later phases.
